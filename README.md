### ✨ Key Features

* **Glassmorphism Effect:** Uses semi-transparent containers with border styling to create a frosted glass look over a background image.
* **Responsive Layout:** Built with `Stack`, `Center`, and `SingleChildScrollView` to ensure the UI looks perfect on all screen sizes and prevents pixel overflow when the keyboard opens.
* **Interactive Password Field:** Includes a "Show/Hide" toggle feature for the password input using `setState`.
* **Full-Screen Background:** Utilizes `BoxDecoration` with `BoxFit.cover` to ensure the background image scales correctly behind the UI.
* **Modern Input Styling:** Custom-styled text fields with white borders and distinct focus states.
